This is a [`Practice Repository`] for [JS] and [React]


## Getting Started

For polishing your JS just go to the [`Interview study js`] folder or alternatively go to [https://jordihernandezlage.com/about] and open the code reference section

For practicing on the [Next.js] react framework just open the [`react sandbox`] folder and [npm] install

The [RunJS] folder is just a data dump of practice and experiments ran on the RunJS application ( which runs js on the fly)

The [practice] folder is self explanatory
